```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-blue-700 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This corrected code uses `via-blue-700` to add an intermediate color in the gradient, improving the visual transition.  It also ensures appropriate padding, rounded corners and a shadow for enhanced visual appeal.  It is crucial to verify color compatibility and include relevant styling classes for expected results.
