```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class to create a linear gradient background. However, if the `from` and `to` colors are not correctly specified or compatible, it can lead to unexpected visual results or even no gradient at all.  Sometimes, the gradient might appear subtly wrong if the colors are too similar. 

Another common issue is forgetting to include necessary classes for proper styling.  For example, omitting `p-4` (padding) or `rounded-lg` (rounded corners) can result in an unappealing gradient display.
